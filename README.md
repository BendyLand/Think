# Think

A statically-typed Scala-inspired language that compiles to machine code via LLVM!

'Think' aims to be a general-purpose language that balances functional and object-oriented paradigms, inspired by Scala's elegance but optimized for lightweight, standalone binaries.

## About

I *really* like Scala, but I really *don't* like its heavy reliance on build tools and project structures, as well as its obvious tie to the JVM. While I don't have any particular issues with the JVM per se, I still find myself preferring to write in languages that compile to a simple, statically-linked binary that can be moved around and invoked from anywhere in the system with minimal effort (C/C++, Rust, Go, Odin, Haskell,OCaml, etc.).

However, I've found that despite these annoyances, I still do really appreciate the syntax and features of Scala when I just need to *think* through a programming problem. Most people use Python for this and that of course has its place, but let me tell you, if you haven't experienced the majesty of just how clear and concise (yes, both!) you can express certain constructs in Scala, I really encourage you to try out the basics. It really is a beautiful language (until it gets messy).

This is my attempt to address this issue. I've always admired language development, and I've always wanted to give it a try, but I've never really had a reason to seriously attempt it. Frankly, I still really don't (there are plenty of great languages out there), but the cool thing about software is that it doesn't really hurt for me to try, and you never even have to use it. If you don't like this language, use another (or even build a new one, if it means that much to you).
